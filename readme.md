## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this GulpJS content.

**I studied this course to make it easier to minifier HTML, CSS, JS for small project instead of webpack (I am using webpack just for big and complex projects) and convert PugJs to HTML and SASS to CSS it was a very interesting trip and I learned a lot from Eng.Ali Elrayes and I wish for him a great success.**
